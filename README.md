# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of the project

In this project, we created an earthquake map that shows the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth. The map shows all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5. The map was created using javaScript and D3 and Leaflet libraries. Using an API request, we retreived the data from the USGS website and plot them on a Mapbox map.
